        <p class="img_title">“Walt Disney,” the name that is synonymous with animation pioneered the art of 
            creating animated film cartoons and revolutionized it. He was a man with great vision and an 
            innovative genius. Walt Disney was born on the 5th December, 1901 and he had 5 older siblings. When he 
            was four, his family moved from Illinois to Marceline. He lived with his family on a farm and it is 
            here that Walt met Fr. Sherwood who encouraged him to sketch a picture of his horse, and this started
             Walts tryst with sketching. Later, when his family moved back to Chicago, Walt took up classes at 
             McKinley High School and night courses at the Chicago Art Institute. At the age of 22, he was 
             airing cartoons called “Laugh-O-Grams” at the local theater. The cartoons were successful enough 
             to afford him a new studio but he went bankrupt because he was unable to afford the huge salaries 
             of his staff. Eventually, he made his way to Hollywood where he set up his studio and made “Alice 
             Comedies”. This heralded the beginning of the Disney Brothers Studio. Walt Disney went on to make 
             many full length cartoons like Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio but his most endearing cartoon remains 
             Mickey Mouse. Walts biggest gift to cinematic pleasure was his use of the "Multiplan Camera." To 
             him goes the credit for the worlds first synchronized sound cartoon. Walt Disney died in 1966 but 
             the mans spirit still lives on through Disney Movies.</p>

            <p class="img_title2">Walt Disney, in full Walter Elias Disney, (born December 5, 1901, Chicago, 
                Illinois, U.S.—died December 15, 1966, Los Angeles, California), American motion-picture and 
                television producer and showman, famous as a pioneer of animated cartoon films and as the 
                creator of such cartoon characters as Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. He also planned and built 
                Disneyland, a huge amusement park that opened near Los Angeles in 1955, and before his death 
                he had begun building a second such park, Walt Disney World, near Orlando, Florida. The Disney
                 Company he founded has become one of the worlds largest entertainment conglomerates. Disneys 
                 imagination and energy, his whimsical humour, and his gift for being attuned to the vagaries 
                 of popular taste inspired him to develop well-loved amusements for “children of all ages” 
                 throughout the world. Although some criticized his frequently saccharine subject matter and 
                 accused him of creating a virtual stylistic monopoly in American animation that discouraged 
                 experimentation, there is no denying his pathbreaking accomplishments. His achievement as a 
                 creator of entertainment for an almost unlimited public and as a highly ingenious 
                 merchandiser of his wares can rightly be compared to the most successful industrialists in 
                 history.</p>

                <p class="img_title3">Disney princess movies have been a part of childhood since their 
                    emergence in 1937. Disney has become a well-integrated part of modern society because 
                    of their success in turning fairy tales into child friendly adventures. Disney used 
                    original fairy tales from around the world to create their Disney Princess movie 
                    franchise. Each Princess has their own hidden history, a storyline unexplored within their 
                    Disney film, that shows a more adult oriented story. In this article the first four 
                    Princesses (Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, and Ariel) original stories and history will
                    be explored in contrast to their movie counterparts.</p>
